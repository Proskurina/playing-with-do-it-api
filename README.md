# playing-with-do-it-api

I am exercising with Do-it API.

It shows volunteer opportunities around particular location and places them on a map.

Volunteer opportunities around you could be found on branch 'around-you'.

To start do `node app.js` from command line.

Also I deployed it (master branch) to heroku:
